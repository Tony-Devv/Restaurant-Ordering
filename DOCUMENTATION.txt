Restaurant Ordering & Billing System — Design Decisions and Rationale

1. Overview
This document explains the architecture, main components, applied design patterns, and SOLID principles for the Restaurant Ordering & Billing System. The codebase is modular and designed for extension and maintainability.

2. High-level architecture
- Facade (RestaurantFacade): single entry point for the ordering workflow (display menu, create order, notify kitchen, billing & payment).
- Domain entities: Order, MenuItem and concrete base items (BasePizza, BaseBurger, BaseDessert, BaseBeverage).
- Customization: AddOnDecorator and concrete decorators (ExtraCheese, Mushrooms, Olives, SpicySauce, BBQSauce).
- Menu creation: Abstract Factory (MenuFactory) for menu families, and Factory Method (PizzaFactory, BurgerFactory) for specific pizzas/burgers.
- Notification: OrderNotifier (subject) and KitchenDisplay/WaiterDisplay (observers).
- Billing: BillingService, TaxCalculator, and Bill.
- Payment: PaymentStrategy implementations: CashPayment, CardPayment, MobileWalletPayment.
- Discounts: DiscountStrategy implementations (PizzaDiscount, MeatDiscount, ChickenDiscount) and DiscountFactory to create strategies.

3. Mapping design patterns to classes
- Facade: RestaurantFacade coordinates ordering flow, factories, billing, payment, and notifications.
- Observer: OrderNotifier (Subject), OrderObserver (interface), KitchenDisplay, WaiterDisplay.
- Decorator: AddOnDecorator and concrete decorators.
- Abstract Factory: MenuFactory and concrete families.
- Factory Method: PizzaFactory, BurgerFactory and concrete implementations.
- Strategy: DiscountStrategy and PaymentStrategy are both Strategy Pattern usages.

4. SOLID principles & justification
- Single Responsibility: each class has a single responsibility (TaxCalculator only computes tax, BillingService handles billing).
- Open/Closed: new menu families, discount rules, payment methods, or add-ons can be added by creating new classes without changing existing code.
- Liskov Substitution: concrete MenuItem and decorators can be used where MenuItem is expected.
- Interface Segregation: small focused interfaces.
- Dependency Inversion: high-level modules depend on abstractions.

5. Extension points
- New menu family: implement MenuFactory.
- New pizza/burger type: extend PizzaFactory.
- New add-on: implement AddOnDecorator.
- New discount rule: implement DiscountStrategy.
- New payment method: implement PaymentStrategy.

6. Notes and caveats
- Order.quantities maps by object identity; implement equals/hashCode on base items for logical equality if needed.
- Console-based simulation; separate UI and business logic for production systems.
- Payment simulation: payments are mocked (no real gateway).
